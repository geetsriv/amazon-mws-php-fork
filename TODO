Unsorted list of pending tasks (which are mostly not reported issues yet).

- abstract Client classes for all libraries
- work on MarketplaceWebServiceOrders library
- add unit tests
- test all sample codes
- update documentation to php doc standards

- *Response seems to be fairly redundant.
    All that differs is the action name(space) - which is a scalar.
